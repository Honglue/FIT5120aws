            <h3>Australian Guidelines for Healthy Eating</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Guideline 1:</strong> To stay at a healthy weight, be
              active and eat the right amount of nutritious food and drinks.
              Children and teens should eat healthy foods to grow well and be
              active every day. Check their growth regularly. Older people
              should eat healthy foods and stay active to keep strong muscles
              and a healthy weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Guideline 2:</strong> Eat a variety of healthy foods every
              day from these five groups:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vegetables: Different types and colours, including beans.
                </li>
                <li>Fruits</li>
                <li>
                  Grains: Whole Grain foods like bread, rice, pasta, and oats.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Proteins: Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts, seeds,
                  and beans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dairy: Milk, yoghurt, cheese, or alternatives, mostly
                  reduced-fat.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Drink plenty of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Guideline 3:</strong> Limit foods with unhealthy fats,
              added salt, sugars, and alcohol. Limit high-fat foods like cakes,
              pastries, and fried foods. Use healthier fats like olive oil and
              avocado. Limit salty foods: Choose low-sodium options and avoid
              adding salt. Limit sugary foods and drinks like candy, soft
              drinks, and sports drinks. If you drink alcohol, keep it to a
              small amount. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid
              alcohol.
